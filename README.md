# Rules

1. Once a week you should write here what you have done during the week. E.g. I drew a sequence diagram for Login. Link: (some link to the diagram). Or I implemented the code for login user story. Link: (some link to the task).
2. The deadline for this is every Tuesday 2 pm.
3. If you do not post anything till the deadline, then I will send you a personal reminder. 
4. If you ignore my reminder, sorry but I will have to report you to Ulno. But do not worry, I will do that only if I will be 100% sure that the person did not participate anywhere.
5. There can be a case when you did not get a task to do. If it is not planned then, please write a DM to me, and then we will think about what to do next.
